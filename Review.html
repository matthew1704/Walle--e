        "Pixar's Wall-e" succeeds at being three things at once: an enthralling animated film, a visual wonderment and a decent science-fiction story. After Kung fu Panda I thought I had just about exhausted my emergency supply of childlike credulity, but here is a film, like Finding Nemo that you can enjoy even if you've grown up. That it works largely without spoken dialogue is all the more astonishing; it can easily cross language barriers, which is all the better, considering that it tells a planetary story." (Robert Ebert 2008)
        Robert has perfectly encapsulated my thoughts on the movie Wall-e. I think it is just incredible the children's movie is both easy to understand and able to portray emotions all with no dialogue from the 2 main characters and little to none from other characters in the movie. This lack of oral communication really emphasizes the amazing work and detail the animators put into there movie and characters, because you are able to understand the movie based on the visuals alone. I also admire the message the movie was also able to get across with watery down the story/plot. In Fact it's actually the story. The story goes that wall-e is a robot left to clean up earth after humans have destroyed it with rubbish and pollution and left to live in space ships away from their home.. Wall-e does his job until he comes across a plant (which was thought to be extinct). he tries to grow it but ends up meeting another robot named Eve who takes him to the humans with his plant. The humans come back to earth and it is assumed that they start to live on earth again after they plant it in the ground. Children watching this story are unknowingly learning about the importance of our earth and vegetation and cleaning up your rubbish. But the movie doesn't seem like one of those cheesy educational movies and the plot just works. Overall wall-e is a movie with amazing visuals, loveable characters and a meaningful plot. For me it is one of disney's best movies

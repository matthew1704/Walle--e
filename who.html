    <h3 class = "biography1">Wall-e</h3> 
<p class = "biography2" >
Walle is a robot. He is about half a meter tall and has a square physique.  
   <br>
He is very caring and portects the innocent.<br> He has a pet cockroach that he feeds and plays with everyday.
    <br> 
Even if wall-e is a robot he still has a heart of gold and is one of the most loveable characters in any disney movie

    <br>
Wall-e is almost fully metal. His "abdomen" is a rusted mustard yellow and has a small control panel and the top of it. His feet/wheels resemble those of a tank just smaller. He has a crane-like neck and a pair of binoculars on top that are colored in a rusted brown and beige. His are the lense of the binoculars. They are big round and black and remind me of puppy dog eyes further emphasizing his caring and innocent nature.
